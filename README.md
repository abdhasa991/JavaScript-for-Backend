🚀 Mission: JavaScript Mastery | 30-Day Sprint
I am skipping the boring, "thakki hui" theory-only approach. My focus is Project-Based Learning—building real stuff to understand how JavaScript actually works.

The goal: Master the language this month, dominate the Backend (Node.js) next month.

🛠 Core Topics I'm Mastering
Modern ES6+ Syntax (Arrow Functions, Destructuring, Spread/Rest)

DOM Manipulation & Event Listeners

Asynchronous JS (Callbacks, Promises, Async/Await)

Fetch API & JSON Handling

Array Methods (Map, Filter, Reduce)

Local Storage & Session Storage

Error Handling & Debugging

JS Modules & Scoping

🏗 Projects in Progress
[ ] Dynamic Weather App (API Integration)

[ ] Interactive Expense Tracker (Logic & Math)

[ ] Personal Task Manager (CRUD Operations)

[ ] Custom Music Player (DOM & Audio API)

🏆 The Grand Finale: Target Project
Real-Time Crypto/Stock Tracker Dashboard
A fully functional dashboard that fetches live market data, allows users to manage a watchlist, and persists data using Local Storage. This project will be my final test before I move to Node.js and the world of Servers.

🎯 Next Month’s Goal
"JavaScript today, Node.js tomorrow." 💻🔥
